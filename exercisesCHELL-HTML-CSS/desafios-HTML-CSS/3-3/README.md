Exercise 1 - A classy gallery
1. Add multiple classes
This webpage has three images in the body, but there are no styles yet.
We've defined a few CSS rules with class selectors at the top. Some of the rules change the size of the image, and others change the border.

Your challenge: is to add two class names to each image so that the sizes and borders vary from each other. Mix and match - try a few out!

Exercise 2 - Classes of elements
1. Make more specific rules
This webpage describes one classification of elements in the periodic table: metals, non-metals, and semi-metals. It uses CSS rules with class selectors to color those words, both in the top paragraph and the headings.
Using what you learned in the last video, style the headings so that their background is the same color as their text. Then change the text color to white so that you can read it. For this step, start by styling the headings with the 'metal' class.

For this step, add a new rule for headings with the 'non-metal' class.

Now let's try doing the same thing for headings with the 'semi-metal' class.

Exercise 3 - Descendants of Khan
1. Add descendant rules
This webpage describes Genghis Khan, an emperor who had many descendants, and includes a table with just a few of the emperors that descended from him. Add a rule that targets only the elements that have the 'emperor' class and are in the table. The rule should change the background color of those table cells.
Add descendant rules
Now add another rule that targets only the elements that have the class name 'reign' and in the table. Like in the first step, the rule should change the background color of those table cells. Pick a different color than you picked for the other rule!
Grouped animals
Group the selectorszs
This is a webpage about animal group names, with a few headings and images as examples.
There are already 2 CSS rules to style the (h1)s - one with a pseudo selector, and one without. Add another selector to each of the rules, so that they also style (h2)s.
