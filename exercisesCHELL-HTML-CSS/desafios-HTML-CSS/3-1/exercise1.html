We are going through turbulence

turbulence within our hearts

the same clouds that rock the planes

are the ones that rock us now

anguish, despair, anxiety and depression

those are the emotions that are inside the cloud

our hearts yearn

yearn for the day that these clouds will empty

and become just peace and joy. </pre>
