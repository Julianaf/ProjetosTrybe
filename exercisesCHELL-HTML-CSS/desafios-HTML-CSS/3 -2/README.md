Exercise 1 - Group the groupers
1. Add spans
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding (span) tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your (span) tags a class called "first-sentence".
2. Style Spans
Good! Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.
3. Add a div
Great! Wrap the paragraphs in a single (div), and then give the div a class of "info"
4. Style the Div
Last step! Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.
Exercise 2 - The overflowing ocean
1. Resize the div
This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a (div).
In this first step, style the (div) that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.

2. Make it scroll
Now, make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.
3. Resize the img
In this last step, write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.
Exercise 3 - The boxer model
1. Add borders
This webpage displays a gallery of photos of boxer dogs. In this first step, add a border to all of the photos. Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can.
2. Add margin
The photos look a bit too close to each other. Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them.
3. Add padding
The photos are too close to the side of the gallery div, and it looks weird. Add padding around all sides of the gallery div so that it looks better.
Exercise 4 - Position planet
1. Position the creature
This webpage contains an image of a planet, an image of a creature, and a div with a greeting. Your job is to make it look like the creature is sitting on the planet and saying the greeting. In this first step, use absolute positioning to put the creature on top of the planet somewhere.
2. Position the greeting
In this second step, position the greeting on top of the planet as well.
3. Order them
Now use a z-index property to make sure that the greeting always shows up over the creature, not behind.
Exercise 5 - Floating clouds
1. Float the photo
2. Float the sidebar
There's a yellow div of information. Make that div float to the right of the text, so that the photo is on the left side of the text and the yellow div is on the right side of the text.

3. Add margins
Now that we have elements floated next to eachother, we should make sure to separate them with some whitespace. Add appropriate margins to the photo and the sidebar.>
